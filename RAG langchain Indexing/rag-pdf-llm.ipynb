It consists of a set of input-output pairs that the model learns from during the training process.\n","Validation Dataset: This dataset is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and to evaluate its performance during training. It helps prevent overfitting by providing an independent dataset that the model hasn't seen during training.\n","Test Dataset: The test dataset is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. It serves as an unseen dataset to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n","Cross-Validation Dataset: In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets. The model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining data for training.
